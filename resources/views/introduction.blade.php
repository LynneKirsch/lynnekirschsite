                <p>
                    I'm a web designer and developer with a passion for what I do. I feel that my unique blend of
                    technical and creative skills set me apart, and I'm very proud of the skillset that I have
                    worked very hard to hone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm the kind of developer that you can give a scope of work to and trust me to take the project
                    from conceptualization, to design, to a live website. I'm able to create wireframes in photoshop
                    or indesign and build the site, along with any needed custom programming. I can even set up the
                    server (or docker container) to deploy the site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because of my diverse range of talents, I'm very good at filling holes wherever there is pressure. You
                    can delegate a wide array of tasks to me and expect quality results.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm great with deadlines and pressure, and I enjoy working in a collaborative environment where there is
                    opportunity to learn and expand my talents even further.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If it sounds like I might be a good fit for you, and you are in or around the Los Angeles area, please
                    feel free to check out my resume, send me an email, or give me a call!
