                                I have put a great deal of effort into learning skills relevant to both web programming and design, keeping myself up to date with
                                latest trends and best practices as well as new and emerging technologies. It is my passion for learning, pushing myself and
                                broadening my skillset that has sparked me to seek new opportunities in the design and programming field.

                                I am currently looking to relocate my talents to the Southern California area.
